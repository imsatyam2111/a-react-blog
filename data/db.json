The difference between JavaScript libraries (like React) and JavaScript frameworks (like Angular (opens in a new tab)) lies in the fact that—in the case of a library—the developer applies library code in individual instances that call for it. When it comes to frameworks, however, the framework creates a scaffolding that arranges your website or application and provides dedicated areas for framework code to be plugged-in.",
