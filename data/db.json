      "body": "React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites. But if you’re not familiar with JavaScript or JavaScript libraries, that’s not a helpful definition. So let’s take a step back and deal with those terms first. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

      "body": "It’s common to see React JS described as both a JavaScript library AND a JavaScript framework, so which is it? Or is it both? At Skillcrush, our curriculum team defines React JS as a JavaScript library and not a framework. This is an important distinction. The difference between JavaScript libraries (like React) and JavaScript frameworks (like Angular (opens in a new tab)) lies in the fact that—in the case of a library—the developer applies library code in individual instances that call for it. When it comes to frameworks, however, the framework creates a scaffolding that arranges your website or application and provides dedicated areas for framework code to be plugged-in.
